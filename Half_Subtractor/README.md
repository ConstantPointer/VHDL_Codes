# Half Subtractor VHDL Project

## Overview
This folder contains the VHDL implementation of a Half Subtractor using three different types of modeling techniques: Dataflow, Behavioral, and Structural. Additionally, it includes the Device Under Test (DUT) and the corresponding testbench files. The project also provides a test generation program in C and Python, which generates input vectors, expected outputs, and output masks for testing the Half Subtractor.
additionally it also contains the outputs.txt and TRACEFILE.txt for the same.

## Contents

### VHDL Files
1. **half_subtractor.vhdl**: This file includes the Half Subtractor implementation using Dataflow, Behavioral, and Structural modeling techniques.
    - **Dataflow Modeling**: Uses concurrent signal assignment to describe the circuit.
    - **Behavioral Modeling**: Uses a process block to describe the circuit behavior.
    - **Structural Modeling**: Uses component instantiation to describe the circuit using AND and XOR gates.

2. **DUT.vhdl**: The Device Under Test (DUT) file for the Half Subtractor. This is the main design file that the testbench will test.

3. **Testbench.vhdl**: The testbench file for simulating the Half Subtractor. It reads input vectors from `TRACEFILE.txt`, applies them to the DUT, and checks the output against expected results by generating `outputs.txt` file .

### Test Generation Files
1. **test_gen.c**: C file used to generate the test vectors for the Half Subtractor. This program creates input vectors and expected output vectors, and writes them to `TRACEFILE.txt`.

2. **test_gen.py**: Python script used to generate the test vectors for the Half Subtractor. This program creates input vectors, expected output vectors, and writes them to `TRACEFILE.txt`

### Test Files
1. **TRACEFILE.txt**: This file contains the input vectors, expected output vectors, and output mask bits for the testbench. It is generated by running the `test_gen` program.

2. **outputs.txt**: This file contains the input vectors and the actual output vectors generated after running and simulating the testbench. It helps in verifying the correctness of the Half Subtractor implementation.

### Running the Test Generation Program
To generate the `TRACEFILE.txt`, compile and run the test generation program (`test_gen.c` and `test_gen.py`).
