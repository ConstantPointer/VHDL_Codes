# Half Subtractor VHDL Project

## Overview
This folder contains the VHDL implementation of a Half Subtractor using three different types of modeling techniques: Dataflow, Behavioral, and Structural. Additionally, it includes the Device Under Test (DUT) and the corresponding testbench files. The project also provides test generation programs in C and Python, which generate input vectors, expected outputs, and output masks for testing the Half Subtractor. Additionally, it contains the `outputs.txt` and `TRACEFILE.txt` for the same.

## Contents

### VHDL Files
1. **half_subtractor.vhdl**: This file includes the Half Subtractor implementation using Dataflow, Behavioral, and Structural modeling techniques.
    - **Dataflow Modeling**: Uses concurrent signal assignment to describe the circuit.
    - **Behavioral Modeling**: Uses a process block to describe the circuit behavior.
    - **Structural Modeling**: Uses component instantiation to describe the circuit using XOR and AND gates.

2. **DUT.vhdl**: The Device Under Test (DUT) file for the Half Subtractor. This is the main design file that the testbench will test.

3. **Testbench.vhdl**: The testbench file for simulating the Half Subtractor. It reads input vectors from `TRACEFILE.txt`, applies them to the DUT, and checks the output against expected results by generating `outputs.txt` file.

### Test Generation Files
1. **test_gen.c**: C file used to generate the test vectors for the Half Subtractor. This program creates input vectors and expected output vectors, and writes them to `TRACEFILE.txt`.

2. **test_gen.py**: Python script used to generate the test vectors for the Half Subtractor. This program creates input vectors, expected output vectors, and writes them to `TRACEFILE.txt`.

### Test Files
1. **TRACEFILE.txt**: This file contains the input vectors, expected output vectors, and output mask bits for the testbench. It is generated by running the `test_gen` program.

2. **outputs.txt**: This file contains the input vectors and the actual output vectors generated after running and simulating the testbench. It helps in verifying the correctness of the Half Subtractor implementation.

### Running the Test Generation Program
To generate the `TRACEFILE.txt`, compile and run the test generation program (`test_gen.c` or `test_gen.py`).

#### Using the C Program
1. Compile the C program:
    ```bash
    gcc test_gen.c -o test_gen
    ```
2. Run the executable to generate `TRACEFILE.txt`:
    ```bash
    ./test_gen
    ```

#### Using the Python Script
1. Run the Python script to generate `TRACEFILE.txt`:
    ```bash
    python3 test_gen.py
    ```

### Simulating the VHDL Design
1. Open your VHDL simulation tool (such as ModelSim or GHDL).
2. Load the `DUT.vhdl` and `Testbench.vhdl` files into the simulator.
3. Run the simulation to verify the Half Subtractor implementation against the test vectors provided in `TRACEFILE.txt`.
4. Check the results in `outputs.txt` to ensure the Half Subtractor is functioning correctly.
