# Universal Gates Project

## Overview

The **Universal Gates** project demonstrates the implementation of basic digital circuits using only NAND gates. Specifically, it includes:

1. **XOR, XNOR, AND, and OR Gates** implemented using NAND gates.
2. **NAND Half Adder** constructed using NAND gates.
3. A VHDL-based testbench for validating the functionality.
4. Various output files capturing simulation results and design views.

## Directory Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `Gates.vhdl` - The VHDL file containing the main code for XOR, XNOR, AND, OR, and NAND Half Adder implementations.
- `DUT.vhdl` - The VHDL file describing the Device Under Test (DUT), which port maps the gates from `Gates.vhdl`.
- `testbench.vhdl` - The VHDL testbench file used to test the DUT.
- `tracefile.txt` - Trace file containing detailed execution steps.
- `output.txt` - File containing the output results of the simulation.
- `RTL_View.pdf` - PDF document showing the RTL (Register Transfer Level) view of the design.
- `output_waveform.png` - PNG image of the output waveform generated by ModelSim.
- `output_waveform.pdf` - PDF document of the output waveform from ModelSim.

## Project Components

### 2. NAND Half Adder

- **Half Adder**:
  - A half adder circuit implemented using only NAND gates, which includes the logic for both sum and carry-out operations.
  - **Number of NAND Gates Required**: 6

### 3. VHDL Files

- **Main Code** (`Gates.vhdl`):
  - Contains the VHDL code for the XOR, XNOR, AND, OR, and NAND Half Adder implementations using NAND gates.
  
- **DUT File** (`DUT.vhdl`):
  - Describes the Device Under Test (DUT) and port maps the gates from `Gates.vhdl`.

- **Testbench** (`testbench.vhdl`):
  - Contains the testbench used to simulate and verify the correctness of the XOR, XNOR, AND, OR, and NAND Half Adder circuits.

## Simulation and Output

- **Simulation Tool**: ModelSim was used for RTL simulation.
- **Output Waveform**: The output waveform from the simulation is available in both PNG and PDF formats.
- **RTL View**: The RTL view of the design provides a high-level overview of the circuit's structure and is documented in `RTL_View.pdf`.

## How to Run the Simulation

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have ModelSim or a similar VHDL simulation tool installed.
2. **Compile**: Compile the `Gates.vhdl`, `DUT.vhdl`, and `testbench.vhdl` files using the VHDL compiler.
3. **Simulate**: Run the testbench to simulate the design.
4. **View Results**: Check the `output_waveform.png` or `output_waveform.pdf` for the waveform results, and `output.txt` for the textual output of the simulation.

## Additional Information

- **Trace File**: The `tracefile.txt` provides a detailed log of the simulation process, useful for debugging and analysis.
- **Output Results**: `outputs.txt` captures the results of the simulation, detailing the behavior of the DUT.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the versatility of NAND gates by implementing fundamental digital circuits and validating their functionality through simulation. The included documentation and output files provide a comprehensive overview of the design and its performance.
